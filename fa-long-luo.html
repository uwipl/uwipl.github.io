<p class="justified">As the Chief Scientist of Micron Technology Inc., USA and IEEE Fellow, Dr. Fa-Long Luo is now also an Affiliate Professor of Electrical Engineering Department at University of Washington in Seattle.  He has 35 years academic, industry and research experience with emphasis on the translation of adaptive signal processing techniques to practical applications and commercial products related to multimedia, wireless communications and digital broadcasting.  Currently, his research interests are mainly in the optimal silicon convergence of application algorithm, computing platform and memory access in terms of high performance, low power and small die-size. The techniques that he is involved mainly include signal processing, wireless networks, reconfigurable computing and tensor access memory (TAM). </p>
<p class="justified">Including his well-received books: "Applied Neural Networks for Signal Processing" (1997, Cambridge University Press) and "Signal Processing for 5G: Algorithms and Implementations" (2016, Wiley-IEEE), Dr. Luo has published 6 books and more than 100 technical papers in the related fields.  Dr. Luo has also contributed 79 patents/inventions which have successfully resulted in a number of new or improved commercial products in massive production. </p>
<p class="justified">Fa-Long Luo has served the Chairman of IEEE Industry DSP Standing Committee and Technical Board Member of IEEE Signal Processing Society.   He has also served as an Associate Editor of "IEEE Access," "IEEE Internet of Things Journal," "St. Petersburg State Polytechnical University Journal of  Computer Science, Telecommunication and Control Systems," and the founding Editor-in-Chief of "International Journal of Digital Multimedia Broadcasting." </p>
<p class="justified">Dr. Luo has been extensively involved in related international standardization activities. He led more than fifty worldwide experts to have edited the first application handbook: "Mobile Multimedia Broadcasting Standards: Technology and Practice" (Springer, 2008). His book: "Digital Front-End in Wireless Communications: Circuits and Signal Processing" was published by Cambridge University Press in 2011and considered the first complete guide for the related chip design and implementation. </p>
<p class="justified">As a principal investigator or participant, he has conducted  nearly thirty research projects,  most of which  have been funded, because of their importance and excellence, by related government agencies such as National Natural Science Foundation of China, German Research Foundation, US Navy and Natural Science and Engineering Council of Canada, respectively. He was also awarded the Fellowship by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany. </p>
